## Implementing an MCP Server for DBMS in Python — YDB’s Experience
Speaker: [Ivan Blinkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanblinkov/)

**What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?**
1. Open protocol to bridge AI models with external systems (APIs, DBMS, tools).
2. Think of it like an adapter layer between LLMs and structured data sources.
3. Enables LLMs to query databases safely and consistently.

**Why Python for MCP?**
1. `High productivity`: rapid prototyping & easy integration.
2. `Rich ecosystem`: FastAPI, asyncio, pydantic → good for protocol servers.
3. `Community support`: Many AI + DBMS SDKs already available in Python.
4. `Testability`: Python tooling (pytest, unittest) makes automated validation easy.

**MCP Server in Action (YDB’s Implementation)**

High-level flow:
```
User Prompt
    |
    v
AI-powered App  --- HTTP / MCP --->  MCP Server (Python)  ---> DB (YDB)
                                   (Request translation)

```
1. LLM sends structured MCP requests (e.g., “fetch customers who ordered last month”).
2. MCP server translates → SQL / YQL query for YDB.
3. Executes against DB and returns results in structured format.
4. LLM consumes + reasons over the DB response.

**Challenges & Lessons**
1. Translation accuracy: ensuring LLM-generated queries map to safe DB queries.
2. Performance: handling large-scale distributed DB queries with low latency.
3. Testing: automated integration tests for MCP endpoints were key.
4. Security: avoid direct free-text SQL from LLM → must use MCP schema enforcement.
5. Scalability: MCP server must handle multiple parallel LLM requests.

**Automated Testing**
1. Used pytest + mock DBs to validate MCP request/response cycles.
2. Stress-tested with synthetic workloads to ensure reliability.
3. Checked error handling: malformed queries, bad schema, network errors.

**Lessons Learned**
1. `Schema-first` approach (define what DB entities are exposed to LLM).
2. Keep protocol lightweight → minimize complexity between LLM & DB.
3. Python async helped a lot for concurrency.

Note: Building an MCP server is less about LLMs, more about strong DB integration.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. MCP is emerging as a standard for connecting LLMs with structured systems.
2. Python is currently the best fit for implementing MCP servers (fast iteration + ecosystem).
3. YDB’s experience highlights the importance of test-driven development for AI+DB bridges.
