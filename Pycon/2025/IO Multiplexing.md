# Building scalable network applications with Python sockets, I/O multiplexing, and asyncio

---

## 1️⃣ Why Concurrency Matters in Network Programming

- Network applications often handle **many simultaneous connections** (clients).  
- **Blocking sockets** and sequential processing are inefficient for high concurrency.  
- Python offers multiple concurrency models:
  1. Multi-threading
  2. I/O multiplexing with `selectors`
  3. Async programming with `asyncio`

## 2️⃣ Threads and Blocking Sockets

- **Traditional approach**: spawn one thread per connection  
- **Challenges**:
  - **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)**: prevents true parallel execution of Python bytecode in multiple threads  
  - **Context switching overhead**: slows down performance under high load  
  - **Memory overhead**: each thread consumes stack space  
  - Blocking I/O → threads can get stuck waiting for data

```python
import socket
from threading import Thread

def handle_client(conn):
    data = conn.recv(1024)
    conn.sendall(data)
    conn.close()

server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8888))
server.listen()

while True:
    conn, addr = server.accept()
    Thread(target=handle_client, args=(conn,)).start()
```
