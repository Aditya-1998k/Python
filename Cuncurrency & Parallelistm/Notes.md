# üß† Overview
Concurrency and parallelism are key for building **efficient, responsive, and scalable applications**.  
This section covers Python‚Äôs built-in and third-party tools for handling **multiple tasks at once**, whether they are **I/O-bound** or **CPU-bound**.

---

## üìÇ Topics Covered

1. **Threading** ‚Äì Lightweight concurrency, best for I/O-bound tasks.
2. **Multiprocessing** ‚Äì Run tasks in separate processes, bypassing the GIL for CPU-bound workloads.
3. **ThreadPoolExecutor** ‚Äì High-level thread pool API for concurrent I/O tasks.
4. **ProcessPoolExecutor** ‚Äì High-level process pool API for parallel CPU-bound tasks.
5. **Asyncio** ‚Äì Asynchronous programming with event loops, tasks, and coroutines.
6. **Third-Party Tools** ‚Äì Libraries like `gevent`, `trio`, and `concurrent.futures` extensions.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Why Learn Concurrency & Parallelism?

- Write **non-blocking applications** (servers, scrapers, data pipelines).
- Scale across **multiple cores** for CPU-heavy workloads.
- Improve **latency and responsiveness** in real-time systems.
- Use the right model for **I/O vs CPU tasks**.
- Master high-level abstractions like executors for simpler concurrency.

# üßµ Threading
### What is Threading?
A thread is a light weight unit of execution inside a **process**. Thread shares
same memory space (unlike processes).

**Best for I/O Bound Task:**
- Network Calls
- File I/O
- API Requests

**Inefficient for CPU Bound Task** Because of Python GIL (Global interpreter Lock)

Basic Example:
```python
import threading
import time

def worker(name):
    print(f"Thread {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Thread {name} Ending")

# Creating Thread
t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=("A",))
t.start()

# Main Thread continue
print("Main thread running...")

# Wait for thread to finish (Optional if you want main thread to wait)
t.join()

print("Main thraed finish")
```

Note: t.join() tells the main program: "Wait until this thread finishes before continuing."
```
Execution flow:
Thread A starting
Main thread is running...
(Main waits until Thread A finishes)
Thread A finished
Main thread finished
```
without t.join() the main thread does not wait for the worker thread. but it also doesn‚Äôt exit until non-daemon threads are done.
```
Execution flow:
Thread A starting
Main thread running...
Main thraed finish
Thread A Ending
```

### Daemon vs Non-Daemon Threads
1. **Non-Daemon Thread** :
Default thread in python. The program wait for them to finish before exiting.
Even if main thread ends, python won't shutdown untill all non-daemon are done.

```python
import threading, time

def worker():
    time.sleep(3)
    print("Worker finished")

# Non-daemon (default)
t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
t.start()

print("Main finished")
```
Output:
```
Main finished
Worker finished
```
The program didn‚Äôt exit immediately ‚Äî it waited 3 seconds for the worker thread.

2. **Daemon Thread**: 
Background thread that kills automatically when main program exits. Program does not weight for
daemon thread to finish. Useful for background task like logging, monitoring or cleanup that does not
need to block program exits.

```python
import threading, time

def log_worker():
    time.sleep(3)
    print("Worker finished")

# Daemon thread
t = threading.Thread(target=log_worker, daemon=True)
t.start()

print("Main finished")
```
Output:
```
Main finished
```
The worker never prints Worker finished ‚Äî because the program ended before it could finish.

Note: Think of non-daemon as ‚Äúimportant work must finish‚Äù and daemon as ‚Äúbackground helper, stop if main ends.‚Äù

##### Running multiple Thread
```python
import threading
import time

def worker(name):
    print(f"Thread {name} starting")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Thread {name} Ending")

threads = []

for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("All threads finished")
```
---

#### Thread Synchronization (Locks)
When multiple threads shares the same data, use lock to prevent race conditions.

Let's create a force race condition
- We can release the GIL by using time.sleep() or C extensions
- Or use Multiprocessing (True Parallelism)

```python
import threading
import time

counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(1000):  # fewer iterations so you can see the issue
        value = counter
        time.sleep(0.0001)   # simulate context switch (GIL Release)
        counter = value + 1

threads = []

for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("Final counter:", counter)  # Often < 5000 because of lost updates
```
Output:
```
Eache thread inceasing the counter by 1000, but actually our output will
be less than 5000
output: 1002
```

Let's fix this problem using lock

Why Lock?

A Lock ensures that only one thread at a time can access a critical section (like modifying counter).
So even if multiple threads run, the counter += 1 operation becomes atomic.

```python
import threading
import time

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(1000):  # fewer iterations so you can see the issue
        with lock:
           value = counter
           time.sleep(0.0001)   # simulate context switch (GIL Release)
           counter = value + 1
threads = []

# start 5 threads
for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("Final counter with lock:", counter)  # Always 5000
```
Output
```
Final counter with lock: 5000
```
