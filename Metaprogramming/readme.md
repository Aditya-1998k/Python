Metaprogramming means **writing codes that manupulates other codes.**
Instead of writing functions/classess to do tasks, you write code that can
create, modify, or control the behaviour of other code at runtime.

In python this means:
1. Inspecting objects (types(), dir(), inspect).
2. Modifying functions/classes at runtime.
3. Using decorators, metaclasses, AST and reflection.
