# Sockets (TCP/UDP) ‚Äì Low-level Network Communication
What is socket?
A socket is a virtual endpoints for sending and recieving data
between two programs over a network.
Think of it as a door between your application and the network.
In python, provided by socket module.

Note: Worked at low level as compared to HTTP library  like requests.

**Why TCP or UDP called low level Network communication?**

TCP and UDP are called low-level networking protocols because:

Networking has layers (OSI model):
```
7. Application   ‚Üí HTTP, FTP, DNS
6. Presentation  ‚Üí encryption, compression
5. Session       ‚Üí managing sessions
4. Transport     ‚Üí TCP, UDP   ‚úÖ
3. Network       ‚Üí IP
2. Data Link     ‚Üí Ethernet, WiFi
1. Physical      ‚Üí cables, radio waves
```
TCP & UDP live at the Transport Layer (Layer 4). They are just above IP and deal with raw data 
delivery between two endpoints. They don‚Äôt understand high-level things like web pages or REST APIs.

**Why ‚ÄúLow-Level‚Äù?**
They work with raw bytes (no JSON, no HTML, no HTTP headers).
Programmer must handle:
1. Message encoding/decoding.
2. Splitting/reassembling messages (especially with TCP streams).
3. Reliability (for UDP).
By contrast, high-level protocols like HTTP, gRPC, MQTT build on top of TCP/UDP and provide more abstraction.

## TCP 
Transmission control protocol is a communication protocol that:
1. Ensures reliable, ordered and error-checked delievery of data
2. Connection oriented - Both client and server first establish the connection before exchanging the data
3. Used in Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), Email (SMTP/IMAP), FTP (File transfer protocol)

Basic Example (Server which will listen for client):

**server.py**
```python
import socket

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind("localhost", 12345)
server_socket.listen()

print("Server is listening on port: 12345)

conn, addr = server_socket.accept()
print("Connected by ", addr)

data = conn.recv(1024).decode()
print("Recieved: ", data)

conn.sendall(f"Echo: {data}.".encode())
conn.close()
```

**client.py**
```python
import socket

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect(("localhost", 12345))  # <-- connect (not bind)

client_socket.sendall(b"Hello TCP Server")
response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
print("Server says:", response)

client_socket.close()
```
1. First run the server.py file
```
python server.py
Server is listening on port 12345...
```
2. Run client.py on other terminal
```
python client.py
Server says: Echo: Hello TCP Server
```

**ASCII FLOW**
```
Client                         Server
------                         ------
socket()                       socket()
connect()   ----------------->  bind() + listen()
send("Hello") --------------->  accept() + recv()
recv("Echo: Hello") <--------  send("Echo: Hello")
close()                        close()
```
Output on server.py terminal
```
Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 47794)
Received: Hello TCP Server
```

Expalaination:

```
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

socket.AF_INET ‚Üí means we‚Äôre using IPv4 addresses (localhost, 127.0.0.1, etc.).
socket.SOCK_STREAM ‚Üí means we‚Äôre using TCP protocol (reliable, connection-oriented).
```

```
server_socket.bind(("localhost", 12345))

Attach the socket to IP + port:
"localhost" = only accept connections from your own computer.
12345 = the port number (must be free).
If another process is already using this port, you‚Äôll see:
OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use.
```

```
server_socket.listen()

Put the socket into listening mode, meaning it will wait for clients to connect.
By default, it allows a backlog (queue) of 5 pending connections.
```

```
conn, addr = server_socket.accept()

Blocking call ‚Üí The program pauses here until a client connects.
conn = a new socket object for communicating with that client.
addr = client‚Äôs address (('127.0.0.1', some_random_port)).
So now your server can talk only with that client.
```

```
data = conn.recv(1024).decode()

Receive up to 1024 bytes of data from client.
.recv() returns bytes ‚Üí .decode() converts it to string.
```

```
conn.sendall(f"Echo: {data}".encode())

Send data back to the client.
.encode() converts string ‚Üí bytes.
.sendall() ensures all data is sent (TCP guarantees reliability).
This makes your server behave like an echo server.
```

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is called connectionless protocol.
Here:
1. No Handshake
2. No gaurantee of delievery
3. No order
4. But **very fast**

Useful for:
1. Streaming audio/video
2. Online Gaming
3. DNS queries

Note: A DNS query is a request from a user's device to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to 
find the numerical IP address associated with a specific domain name.

**Comparison with TCP**
```
-------------------------------------------------------------
     TCP:              |           UDP:
-------------------------------------------------------------
 Client ‚Üî Server       |      Client ‚Üí Server
(Handshake, reliable)  |    (No connection, fire & forget)
```

Basic Example:

**server.py**
```python
import socket

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
server_socket.bind(("localhost", 12345))

print("UDP server is listening on port : 12345")

while True:
         data, addr = server_socket.recvfrom(1024)     # Recieve packet + client address
         print(f"Recieved from {addr}: {data.decode()}")
         server_socket.sendto(f"Recieved you Message: {data.decode()}".encode(), addr)
```

**client.py**

```python
import socket

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

client_socket.sendto(b"Hello UDP server", ("localhost", 12345))
data, addr = client_socket.recvfrom(1024)

print("server says: ", data.decode())

client_socket.close()
```

1. Start the server first
2. Start the client

Output (server.py)
```
UDP server is listening on port : 12345
Recieved from ('127.0.0.1', 52604): Hello UDP server
```

Output(client.py)
```
server says:  Recieved you Message: Hello UDP server
```

Explaination:
```python
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

AF_INET ‚Üí IPv4
SOCK_DGRAM ‚Üí means UDP socket (datagram-based, connectionless).
If this were SOCK_STREAM, it would be TCP.
```

```python
server_socket.bind(("localhost", 12345))

Attach the socket to IP & port.
"localhost" = local machine only.
12345 = port number.
Now the OS knows: ‚ÄúAnything sent to 127.0.0.1:12345 via UDP goes to this socket.‚Äù
```

```python
print("UDP Server is listening on port 12345...")

Note: Just a message ‚Üí But ‚ö†Ô∏è technically, UDP doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúlisten‚Äù (no connections).
```

**Why no listen() in UDP?**

Because UDP is connectionless:
In TCP:
1. You must listen() ‚Üí wait for a client ‚Üí accept() ‚Üí establish a connection.
2. Communication happens on that connection (reliable stream).

In UDP:
1. No connection exists.
2. Clients just fire off datagrams to the server‚Äôs IP:port.
3. Server just receives them ‚Üí no handshake, no accept(), no listen().

That‚Äôs why your server goes straight to recvfrom() without listen().

- TCP = Phone call üìû (connection established, then talk).
- UDP = Postcard üìÆ (send message directly, no setup, may be lost).
